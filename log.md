# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Kelli Wise

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 (CSS)
First project - continue my 100 days of CSS project as I work through the 4th edition of CSS the Definitive Guide by Eric Meyer and Estelle Weyl. I started this in November and put it on pause in December as I prepped for the holidays and finished up some end of year work projects.

**Today's Progress**: pages 200 - 236 - working on text formatting. Nothing earth shattering here that I haven't used before but it was a good read, especially on the text box. 

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 6 on text properties, so pages 236 - 256. Interesting stuff on white space and writing modes. 

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here but writing modes, which I've not used before, looks like fun to play with.

**Link(s) to work**: [Fun with writing Modes](https://codepen.io/kwise/pen/KZqLgG)

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Started Chapter 7 on Basic Visual Formatting, pages 256 - 265. Display:block, Display:inline along with box-sizing stuff.  

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here.

**Link(s) to work**: [Block Boxes 1](https://codepen.io/kwise/pen/rpGwMV)

### Day 4: January 4, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Started Chapter 7 on Basic Visual Formatting, pages 265 - 284. Boxes, margins, padding, auto.  

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here but a very nice discussion about collapsing margins. Some interesting ideas for fun formatting with negative margins on some elements.

**Link(s) to work**: [Blocks part 2](https://codepen.io/kwise/pen/MrEGWj)

### Day 5: January 5, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Was stuck waiting on hold, so I hopped over to Free Code Camp and finished up the first half of "Responsive Design with Bootstrap".   

**Thoughts**: Working on the certification as a front end developer.

**Link(s) to work**: None. It's all online.
