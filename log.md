# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Kelli Wise

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 (CSS)
First project - continue my 100 days of CSS project as I work through the 4th edition of CSS the Definitive Guide by Eric Meyer and Estelle Weyl. I started this in November and put it on pause in December as I prepped for the holidays and finished up some end of year work projects.

**Today's Progress**: pages 200 - 236 - working on text formatting. Nothing earth shattering here that I haven't used before but it was a good read, especially on the text box. 

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 6 on text properties, so pages 236 - 256. Interesting stuff on white space and writing modes. 

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here but writing modes, which I've not used before, looks like fun to play with.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Started Chapter 7 on Basic Visual Formatting, pages 256 - 265. Display:block, Display:inline along with box-sizing stuff.  

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Started Chapter 7 on Basic Visual Formatting, pages 265 - 284. Boxes, margins, padding, auto.  

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here but a very nice discussion about collapsing margins. Some interesting ideas for fun formatting with negative margins on some elements.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Was stuck waiting on hold, so I hopped over to Free Code Camp and finished up the first half of "Responsive Design with Bootstrap".  And then I finished that section and got to the beginning of the jQuery section. Decided to do the jQuery section, too and completed it. Now I'm up to the "Build a Tribute Page" development project.

**Thoughts**: Working on the certification as a front end developer.

**Link(s) to work**: None. It's all online.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 (Free Code Camp)

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed the 1st Front End Project - a Tribute page.  

**Thoughts**: Researching the content took longer than the page itself. I am actually using Bootstrap, since it's easy to implement on CodePen. Very little custom CSS. The whole project took a little over an hour.

### Day 7: January 7, 2018 (Free Code Camp)

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed the 2nd Front End Project - a Portfolio page with navigation, thumbnails, etc.  

**Thoughts**: Used Bootstrap again but with a lot of custom CSS. If you're going to do a portfolio project, you might as well make it look good-ish. Would be happier with more attention to the background photo, but the point here was to hand code a single page website in html and css. I surprise myself with how much html and css I know since the only thing I had to refer to was Bootstrap, which is pretty new to me. 

Other thoughts: I need to create a Bootstrap-like framework for my own projects which is grid enabled and much lighter weight than Bootstrap. I also need to commit the code for these projects to github so I have real access to them in the future. And so it show up in my commit history. :-)
