# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Kelli Wise

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 (CSS)
First project - continue my 100 days of CSS project as I work through the 4th edition of CSS the Definitive Guide by Eric Meyer and Estelle Weyl. I started this in November and put it on pause in December as I prepped for the holidays and finished up some end of year work projects.

**Today's Progress**: pages 200 - 236 - working on text formatting. Nothing earth shattering here that I haven't used before but it was a good read, especially on the text box. 

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 6 on text properties, so pages 236 - 256. Interesting stuff on white space and writing modes. 

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here but writing modes, which I've not used before, looks like fun to play with.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 (CSS)

**Today's Progress**: Started Chapter 7 on Basic Visual Formatting, pages 256 - 265. Display:block, Display:inline along with box-sizing stuff.  

**Thoughts**: Again, nothing too new here.
